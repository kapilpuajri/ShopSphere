# ShopSphere

ShopSphere is a modern, full-stack e-commerce platform designed to deliver a seamless and intelligent shopping experience. Built with cutting-edge technologies including React 19 with TypeScript for the frontend and Spring Boot 3.2.0 for the backend, ShopSphere combines a sleek, responsive user interface with robust server-side architecture. The application features comprehensive product management, secure user authentication through JWT and Keycloak integration, and an advanced product recommendation system that intelligently suggests complementary items to enhance the shopping journey. With support for shopping carts, wishlists, order management, and product reviews, ShopSphere provides all the essential features expected from a contemporary e-commerce solution.

What sets ShopSphere apart is its intelligent recommendation engine that analyzes product relationships and shopping patterns to suggest relevant items to customers. For instance, when viewing a smartphone, the system automatically recommends phone covers, data cables, and screen protectors, while for clothing items, it suggests complementary pieces from the same category. The platform leverages Redis caching for optimal performance, implements full-text search capabilities across product names, descriptions, and categories, and supports dynamic pricing with discounts ranging from 5% to 50%. With Docker containerization for easy deployment, high-quality product images, and a user-friendly interface styled with Tailwind CSS, ShopSphere represents a complete, production-ready e-commerce solution that balances functionality, performance, and user experience.
